Goal: Predicting the urbanization rate of a country

In our model, we aim to predict the urbanization rate of the U.S. from 2021 to 2023 using a training dataset spanning 2016 to 2020. Specifically, we investigate whether the urbanization rate can be accurately predicted based on its correlation with variables such as total sugar consumption, sugar import and export volumes, population, daily average sugar intake, average retail price per kilogram, and sugarcane production yield. We will create different training models by dropping variables that seem “irrelevant” to the change of urbanization.

There are 26 columns in the global sugar consumption trends data set. 

Country
The country where the data is collected

Country code
A three-letter-code representing the country

Year
The year when data was collected

Continent
The continent of which the country is located

Region
Where the country is located after subdividing a continent by directions  (e.g. East Asia) and geographical features (e.g. Sub-Saharan Africa)

Population
The total number of citizens in a country.

GDP per capita
A country’s total economy divided by its population

Per capita sugar consumption
The total sugar consumption of the country divided by its population

Total sugar consumption
Synthesized total amount of sugar consumed by people in a country

 Sugar from sugarcane
Synthesized percentage of sugar extracted from sugarcane

 Sugar from beets
Synthesized percentage of sugar extracted from beets

 Sugar from HFCS
Synthesized percentage of sugar extracted from high-fructose corn syrup

 Sugar from others
The percentage of sugar extracted from medium other than sugarcane, beet, and HFCS

 Processed food consumption
The total amount of processed food consumed by a country

 Daily Average sugar intake
The average amount of sugar a person consumes  per day

 Diabetes prevalence
The percentage of people in the country who have diabetes

 Obesity rate
The percentage of people in the country who is obese

 Sugar imports
The amount of sugar imported from other countries

 Sugar exports
The amount of sugar exported to other countries

 Average retail price per kilogram
The average retail price of sugar per kilogram

 Government tax
Whether government proposed a sugar tax

 Government subsidy
Whether government subsidized sugar consumption

 Education Campaign
Though included, the source of the data set does not provide any information about this column. All we know is that it's a categorical variable.

 Urbanization rate
The percentage of the urbanized regions over the total area of a country in a year

 Climate condition
A rating of climate conditions for the year in corresponding countries using 1 to 5. 1 stands for least favorable climate, and 5 stands for the most favorable climate.

 Sugarcane production yield
The local sugarcane production per year
